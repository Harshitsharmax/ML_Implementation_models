## Models Overview
1. **Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering** - Customer segmentation is a technique used by businesses to divide customers into groups based on common characteristics. In this model, the KMeans clustering algorithm is employed to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior.

2. **Movie Recommendation System** - A movie recommendation system helps users discover new movies based on the movie name suggested. This model employs a collaborative filtering technique to recommend movies to users based on their cosine similarity score.
